SETTING THE LOOK OF THE TERMINAL ITSELF:
Terminal > Preferences > Profiles 
There you can either create your own theme or just choose a prepared one.
In your own customized theme you are free to choose the color of the text, set how colors might differ depending on the function (allow ANSI colors for that). You can also choose the type of cursor, font, etc.

SETTING YOUR PROMPT LINE:
It's all started with my prompt line being too long as it showed my username +hostname (my name + type of my Macbook) + working directory. So, I decided to customize it. 

I googled several ways to do that, but they didn't work for my Mac. Then I discovered that these numerous guides on customizing your Terminal were written for the bash that is no longer available for Macs running on iOS Catalina and newer. New shell is called Z Shell, or shortly zsh. There are fewer tutorials on how to set it, so I wrote one.

1. Create .zshrc file where you will store all directions for your Terminal appearance in your home (~) directory:
cd ~ #go to home directory
touch .zshrc

2. Open it in vim/nano/other text editor
vim ~/.zshrc
then press 'i' to start INSERT mode

3. Now you can customize your prompt. So, default one would be:
PROMPT='%n@%m %. %% '
%n stands for user
%m machine
%. current working directory
%% symbol of % 

If you want to play with color:
add %F{color}%f where instead of 'color' you should type either name (black, white, green) or code(0-255). 
More on color coding here: https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/
You can also make it bold by using %Btext%b

For example, 
PROMPT='%n %B%F{56}%.%f%b %F{white}:>%f '

If you want to add git info:
paste the following code:

# version control info
autoload -Uz vcs_info
precmd() { vcs_info }
# editing vcs_info_msg_0_ variable
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats 'branch %b'
# setting prompt
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
PROMPT='%n %F{11}${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f :> ' #just an example feel free to customize as you want

4. Push 'Esc' button. Type ':x' to save and quit

5. Run
source ~/.zshrc
